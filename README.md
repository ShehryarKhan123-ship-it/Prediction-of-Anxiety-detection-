# Student Anxiety Detection Project

This project aims to detect student anxiety levels using machine learning techniques, helping identify patterns and contributing factors that may impact student well-being and academic performance.

## 📌 Introduction

**Problem Statement:**  
Student anxiety is a growing concern, affecting academic success and overall mental health. This project seeks to develop models that can predict student anxiety levels based on various influencing factors.

### 🧠 Methodology

#### 🔹 Data Collection
- Utilized a dataset with features such as timestamp, age, and study hours.
- Enhanced the dataset by integrating key psychological indicators:
  - Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS)
  - Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)
  - Social Phobia (SP)

#### 🔹 Data Preprocessing
- Cleaned and formatted the dataset for analysis.
- Handled missing values and outliers.

#### 🔹 Model Development
Built and evaluated three Linear Regression models:
- **Model 1:** Predicts anxiety based on timestamp.
- **Model 2:** Predicts anxiety based on age.
- **Model 3:** Predicts anxiety based on study hours.

#### 🔹 Model Evaluation
- Assessed models using metrics such as R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- Visualized predictions for comparative analysis.

## 📊 Results

- Included comparative visualizations of the three models' predictions.
- Identified key features influencing student anxiety levels.
- Provided interpretability and insight into which variables are most impactful.

## 🔮 Future Work

- Experiment with more advanced models (e.g., Support Vector Regression, Random Forest).
- Integrate additional features such as academic scores, sleep patterns, and social support systems.
- Build an interactive, user-friendly dashboard or interface for broader accessibility.
